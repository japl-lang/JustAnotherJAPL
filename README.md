# JAJ - Just Another JAPL
Repository for the v2 implementation of [the japl programming language](http://github.com/japl-lang).

Once most of the changes from this version are merged (or well, replace) the current JAPL implementation
this repository will be yeeted into the void. This is just a way for me to start from scratch without any of the messy legacies of the current codebase, which lacks modularity and inherits way too much from the C code of Lox (see Credits)

## Credits

JAPL was inspired by Bob Nystrom's amazing [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book
